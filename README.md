[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Mp3Tagger is a simple program that allows you to automatically add title, album, artist to your mp3 files by using their location.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è

- This program automatically renames all your mp3 files in a format compatible with all types of devices (even older mp3s)
- Make sure that you input the right directory to prevent file losses or file corruption
- Make sure that ALL your files in the input_directory are all mp3s
- I suggest to make a backup of your input_directory before use the program, I will not assume any responsibility about data losses
